# Puppet Data Service (PDS)

This project is owned by the Puppet Solutions Architects team. It is in an early stage of development and only intended to be used by Puppet Enterprise customers, in close collaboration with its developers.

## Summary

The Puppet Data Service (PDS) provides a centralized API-driven interface for Puppet node data and for Hiera data. PDS supports self-service use cases, and Puppet-as-a-Service (PUPaaS) use cases, providing a foundational mechanism for allowing service customer teams to get work done without requiring manual work to be performed by the PUPaaS team.

The PDS consists of:

1. A database backend. At present PostgreSQL is supported. Backends are pluggable, and support for other backends is planned.
2. An API service.
3. A command-line interface (CLI) for human operators.
3. Several Puppet integration components which let Puppet consume data from the API.
4. A Puppet module ([puppetlabs-puppet\_data\_service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppet_data_service)) to aid in setup and configuration.

## Setup

Review the [puppetlabs-puppet\_data\_service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppet_data_service) module for detailed information on how to install, configure, and run the service.
